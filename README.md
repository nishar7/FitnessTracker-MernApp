# FitnessTracker


 **How the web application works**
This single page application uses the MongoDB, Express, React, and Node (MERN)
Stack to implement a REST API and a graphical interface for logging Fitness Web App.
The home page greets the user with a table of past exercises. An exercise can
be edited, or deleted, by clicking on the appropriate icon within the table.

Click the "plus" button on the home page to create a new exercise,

Note that when creating or editing an exercise the data is
validated to help ensure accurate input.

After editing or creating an exercise the user is taken back to the home page to view the
updated table.
